This program shall simulate a process/thread accessing its pages during execution. 
which you shall create. This file shall be located in the same directory as the executable 
and shall contain a series of positive integers representing the pages (by it’s page number) 
which the process/thread is accessing as it performs it’s work. The limit of number of 
pages any process/thread may have is 99. The pages.txt file will contain a single line of 
text where each number is separated by a space character.

//Upon startup, prompt the user for the number of frames in main memory 
//Read the sequence of pages accessed from the file "pages.txt" : The 
//sequence of pages the page/thread accesses will be contained here This file shall be located in the same directory as the executable 
//and shall contain a series of positive integers representing the pages (by it’s page number) which the process/thread is accessing as

//Run each of the algorithms (OPT, LRU, and Clock) on the same input string from the step above 


//Printout the number of faults each algorithm generates to the terminal.
